MYSQL Docs say :
 1. wait_timeout : The number of seconds the server waits for activity on a
   noninteractive connection before closing it. The default value is 28800.

 2. connect_timeout : The number of seconds that the mysqld server waits for
   a connect packet before responding with Bad handshake. The default value is 10 seconds.
connect_timeout mysql is mapped to timeout defined in data_base.yml rails which is set to 5 seconds default.
